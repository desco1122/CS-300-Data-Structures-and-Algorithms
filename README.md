# Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design

*What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?*

The main problem I was solving in the projects for this course was how to use data structures and algorithms to efficiently store, organize, and manipulate data. In Project One, I analyzed the runtime and memory of different data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, and stacks. This helped me to understand the trade-offs between different data structures and how to choose the right data structure for a particular problem. In Project Two, I implemented a sorting algorithm to sort a list of courses in alphanumeric order. This helped me to understand how to use sorting algorithms to efficiently organize data.

*How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.*

I approached the problems in the projects by first researching different data structures and algorithms. I then tried to understand the trade-offs between different approaches and how to choose the right approach for a particular problem. Once I had a plan, I implemented my solution and tested it thoroughly. Data structures are important to understand because they provide efficient ways to store, organize, and manipulate data. By understanding different data structures and algorithms, we can write programs that are more efficient and scalable.

*How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?*

One roadblock I encountered while going through the activities and projects was understanding certain algorithms. For example, I had difficulty understanding the quick sort algorithm at first. I overcame this roadblock by reading multiple explanations of the algorithm and watching video tutorials. I also implemented the algorithm on a small example to better understand how it worked.

*How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?*

My work on this project has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs in several ways. First, I have learned how to use data structures and algorithms to efficiently store, organize, and manipulate data, this has helped me write more efficient and scalable code. I have also learned how to think more carefully about the trade-offs between different approaches to solving a problem. This has helped me to write better programs that are more robust and easier to maintain.

*How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?*

My work on this project has evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable in several ways. I have learned to use more descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. This makes my code easier to read and understand. Overall, my work on the projects for this course has helped me to become a better software developer. I have learned how to use data structures and algorithms to efficiently store, organize, and manipulate data. I have also learned how to design software and develop programs that are more maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
